# hello-world
This is a repository which contains my greeting to the world. It's basically the best thing ever if you didn't realize.

I am sitting in a room. The room contains desks; also, there are chairs.

Rob is next to me. There is a water bottle on my desk; there is water inside it so that I can drink it if I get thirsty (which happens fairly regularly iirc)

I don't really need to poop right now. Will commit when this changes.
